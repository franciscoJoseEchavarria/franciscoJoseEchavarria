- 👋 Hi, I'm Francisco Echavarría, I'm a software developer in training. Currently, I'm studying with the Nodo Eafit university and this training will end in May of this year.
- 👀 I'm interested in being a software developer. I'm learning different technologies like HTML, CSS, React, Java, JavaScript, C# with the Angular, Remix and SpringBoot FramerWorks...
- 💞️ My projects are with the Eafit university and Comfama. I've finished my procedures from the first module and right now I'm taking the second module. In the first module I finished a project with different technologies like HTML, Css, Javscript, Typescript and Java as Backend with Postgres SQL Database. This project is referenced in all repositories as Amadeus frontend. It's made with Angular Framework.
- Now, I'm migrating this project in Remix and C#. This project can be seen under the name Project-Amadeus-Remix. The project must have services and a page where the administrator can see and access different RestApi like GET; DELETED and PUT.
